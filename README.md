Einsicht / `1s` â€“ Intelligent Minimalist SDI Text-Viewer & -Editor / Mini-IDE
=============================================================================
This is a text-editor / integrated-development-environment built for SDI
(Single Document Interface) operations, made to be used with modern window-
managers that allow for efficient management of many single-document windows.

**Currently this project is still in the very beginning and under heavy development,
the vast majority of features are not yet implemented.**

## Why the name and what's up with the "1s" abbreviation?
I like the name for a variety of reasons:
* It is a german word, highlighting the german origins of the project.
* The name translates to "Insight", and it's biggest purpose is to give insight into files
* The prefix "Ein" means "One", relating to the fact that it is a single-document-interface

The abbreviation `1s` (1 = "One" = "Ein"; s => "sicht") will be used so that the editor can be
quickly invoked from the command line. The keys "1" and "s" are very close on QWERTY keyboards.

## Implementation
This project is written in Python, using Pyside6/Qt6 as the UI framework.
Every open document runs in it's own process, communication between 
processes/documents is done using DBUS.

Logs are sent to systemd-journal and can be viewed using this command:
```bash
journalctl -f SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=einsicht
```

## Features
**Implemented** Features:
* Open/Edit/Save ASCII files
* Dynamic Window-Size based on file contents
* Open-only-Once: If you try to open the same file twice, 
  the first window is presented instead
* Line-Numbers
* Syntax-Highlighting
* Highlighting of selected words
* AST-Parsing for implemented languages (see below)

Planned **Common** Features:
* Git Integration
* Line-Sorting / -Filtering
* Formatters / Prettyfiers (JSON / YAML / ...)
* Search & Replace

Planned **Uncommon** (for text-editors) Features:
* Project-Indexing / -Autocompletion (Abstracted per Language)
* Step-Debugger implementation 
  (Abstracted per Protocol. f.e.: dbgp/X-Debug for PHP)
* Edit in multiple places at once (Multi-Cursor)
* In-Code Warnings (f.e.: Results of static analysis)
* Intelligent suggestions for code-completion based on big-data analysis of AST trees.

Features that will **never** be implemented:
* Document-Management using tabs
* Additional toolbars, statusbars or other clutter in the main editor window

**Implemented Languages**:
* Python

**Planned** Languages that may be implemented next (in this order):
* Markdown
* Shell-Script
* XML / HTML
* Javascipt / Typescript
* Java or PHP (not sure which will come first, both are important to me)


## Why SDI?
Most (if not all) other IDE's are written as big bulky MDI (multi-document-
interface) applications that run in a single big window and do not interface 
well with the rest of the system (window-manager).

I think that using tabs for document management is a very bad and inefficient
workaround that was created sometime in the nineties (by mozilla, I believe)
to work around the horribly bad window-management capabilities of MS Windows.

On the regular I see my collegues have multiple browser windows open with
dozens of tabs in each window. There is not even enough space for each tab
in the tab-bar to render an icon for the tab.
Searching for a single web-page sometimes takes them **minutes** while I stand
behind them waiting for then to find the right document.
You have a super high-speed computer at your hands, why in the world do you
still have to search for your documents by hand?!
The reason why is that every single application implements it's own (MDI)
document-management (mostly using tabs).
If applications would defer their document-management to the window-manager,
there could be one central point where all documents could be managed/searched.

I belive in an SDI approach, where every document (textfile, image, terminal, 
website, ...) is displayed in it's own window and the window-manager
(KDE/GNOME/...) is responsible for managing all of these documents.
KDE is (to my knowledge) the only window-manager that actually allows for
an efficient management of many small windows. 
Ubuntu Unity was another example, but unfortunately that WM was discontinued.

How do **I** find my windows? Simple: hit the [Expose][1] key on my keyboard,
see all my open windows at once and then use the Fulltext-Search to go directly
to my desired window within seconds.

I have configured all my applications to be used in an SDI fashion and use
KDE as a window-manager to handle them all.

## Why not use or modify an existing editor?
This project is meant to replace my current go-to editor, which is gedit with a
lot of plugins (some written by me). GNOME moves in a direction that I don't 
like (f.e.: removing menus).
And instead of taking gedit, suppressing half of the functionality (tabs) and 
adding other functionality that gedit was never designed for, I decided to just
build my own minimalist editor.
I've also looked at kate (too overloaded with unwanted UI: tabs) and kwrite (no extension support).
